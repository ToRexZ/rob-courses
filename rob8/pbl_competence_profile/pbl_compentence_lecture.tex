\author{Victor Risager}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is the final workshop at aalborg university.

\section{Exercise 1: What competences do I have}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I am used to working in teams wile I am still able to work alone 
	\item I am sufficient in working in ROS 
	\item I have worked in education relevant companies. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Why?}
Students generally overestimate the weight of the techinical skills relative to soft skills in the job world. 
How can we apply the soft skills for jobs.
Technical skills will get the job interview, but the generic skills will result in getting the job.


\section{Competences}
The most important competencess denoted by great company leaders:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Curriosity.
\end{itemize}
This was the most important soft skill.

If you are able to learn, and want to learn quickly, we will be fine. 


\begin{itemize}
	\item I need to show that I fit well in teamwork settings. 
\end{itemize}
The difficult part is finding the problem that is worth solving rather than solving the problem. 

\vspace{5pt}
you will often just progress to be a manager $ \rightarrow $ The amount of engineering goes down afterwards. 


These stats are mostly applicable in scandinavian countries. 


\section{T-shaped engineering}
Need to have teams that are both deth- and breadth of knowledge.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If you are able to communicate the knowledge to people outside the field, then you are ahead of the field. 
\end{itemize}

It is important to reflect and analyze your learning abilities.
\begin{itemize}
	\item What the hell am i doing wrong. 
\end{itemize}

Most of the work in real life is only 20\%  is typical engineering, the rest is emails, meetings etc.


\section{Litteracies}
Cultural litteracies are very different, so it is important to consider people in other countries in other countries. Consider if you should address people on their first name. 


If I can show examples of what i have done, that is very important. 


Do not attach the competence profile on a job application. However base your competences on that. 


Base your text on your primary experiences. 

\section{Questions}
Are the competences just buzzwords that do not fit into every company and persons who are not familiar with the PBL structure. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item They are just trying to supply the vocabulary of the competences to communicate them effectively.
\end{itemize}

If we are taught how to run a marathon, then it is easy to run 5km.
