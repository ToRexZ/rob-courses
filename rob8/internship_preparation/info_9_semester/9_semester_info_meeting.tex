\section{Project Oriented stay in a company}
The work done must have influence on the company. The most important thing is the description of the tasks. Negotiate the tasks prior to start. We submit a report and then we get a passed/not passed exam. 

The contact at Aalborg University is more like a contact person rather than a supervisor. They will also be the examiner. 
\subsection{NDA}
It is possible to write an NDA. The supervisor are not allowed to assign NDA's without the approval of the university. In case the NDA is written by the company them selves, it has to be approved by the legal department at Aalborg Univisersity. 

\subsection{Report}
Do the same type of structure as usually, but just scale it down to fit the scope of a single person.

\subsection{Student work}
If at the same company, the tasks must be seperated, to easily determine that i am not getting paid for the work. The amount of work does not necessarily correspond to the number of hours. It is possible to increase the stay to include august and january, and then propose a shorter work week, to e.g. accomodate a job. 

\subsection{10'th semester}
It is possible to do a thesis in collaboration with a company. 


\section{Questions}
Do you have to have an agreement of student job before the contract is signed. \\
- No it is not necessary, but be carefull with the work overlap.
