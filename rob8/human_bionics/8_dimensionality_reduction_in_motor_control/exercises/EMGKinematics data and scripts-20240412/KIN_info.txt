Kinematics dataset
Sampling frequency of kinematic data: 80 Hz

The data refers to joint position (or joint angles, expressed in degrees)
from healthy young adults during normal walking.
The 100 rows represent time, from 0 to 100% of the gait cycle, segmented from right heel strike to the following right heel strike).
The 9 columns contain 9 joint angles as follow:

1 - ankle dorsi/plantarflexion (where dorsiflexion are positive angles, and plantarflexion are negative angles)
2 - ankle inversion/eversion*
3 - ankle internal/external rotation*
4 - knee flexion/extension*
5 - knee valgus/varus or adduction/abduction*
6 - knee internal/external rotation*
7 - hip flexion/extension*
8 - hip abduction/adduction*
9 - hip internal/external rotation*

* the same rationale for the positive and negative angles described to ankle dorsi/plantarflexion (positive/negative)
